Abstract
========

This REP documents extensions to the Simple Message protocol
that support Cartesian motion, and the reporting of information about
objects in the robot's workspace.

Motivation
==========

The Simple Mesage protocol defines a low-level interface to robot
controllers that can easily be implemented. Together with reference
implementations of Robot Operating System (ROS) trajectory planners,
Simple Message provides a way for robot vendors to quickly provide
baseline ROS functionality to their systems. 

Simple Message is a joint-level interface that requires the external
system to perform the inverse kinematics calculations. Robot
controllers typically provide this function internally, and the
proposed extensions enable external systems to benefit from the
vendor's built-in kinematics. 

The extensions also include messages for reporting the location and
other information about objects in the robot's immediate environment
that may be tracked using built-in capabilities of the robot
controller. 

Message Specifications
======================

Cartesian Move Request
----------------------
A Cartesian move message requests that the robot move to the specified
Cartesian position and quaternion orientation along a straight line
and about a fixed rotational axis. The translational speed applies to
the motion along the straight line. The rotational speed applies to
the motion about the fixed axis. Translational and rotational motion
should finish at the same time, and in general one of these speeds may
be slower than specified to ensure simultaneous arrival. The sequence
number provided will be used in subsequent messages from the robot
controller to associate replies and status with the move request.

Format of a Cartesian move request::

  int length: 4 bytes, constant value 13 x 4 = 52
  int message_type: 4 bytes, constant value 31
  int comm_type; 4 bytes, constant value 2, REQUEST
  int reply_type: 4 bytes, ignored, any value, typically 0
  int seq_number: 4 bytes, identifying this request
  float x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw: 4 bytes each, for the requested
  Cartesian position and quaternion rotation
  float translational_speed: 4 bytes, the speed to be applied to the
  translational part
  float rotational_speed: 4 bytes, the speed to be applied to the
  rotational part

Cartesian Move Reply
--------------------
The robot controller should reply to each Cartesian move request with
a reply that the request can be initiated. Immediately upon receipt of
the move request, the robot controller should reply with this message
with the reply_type set to 3 (EXECUTING), or 2 (FAILURE) if
the move request is not possible. When the motion has finished, the
robot controller should reply with the reply_type set to 1 (SUCCESS),
or 3 (FAILURE) if the move did not finish where requested.

Format of a Cartesian move reply::

  int length: 4 bytes, constant value 4 x 4 = 16
  int message_type: 4 bytes, constant value 31
  int comm_type; 4 bytes, constant value 3, REPLY
  int reply_type: 4 bytes, 1 = SUCCESS, 2 = FAILURE, 3 = EXECUTING
  int seq_number: 4 bytes, identifying this request

Cartesian Move State
---------------------
The robot controller should continually send back Cartesian move state
messages as the move progresses, with the current pose and speeds of
the robot. The format is the same as for the request message, except
that the comm_type is 1, TOPIC. 

Format of a Cartesian move state message::

  int length: 4 bytes, constant value 13 x 4 = 52
  int message_type: 4 bytes, constant value 31
  int comm_type; 4 bytes, constant value 1, TOPIC
  int reply_type: 4 bytes, ignored, any value, typically 0
  int seq_number: 4 bytes, identifying this request
  float x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw: 4 bytes each, for the requested
  Cartesian position and quaternion rotation
  float translational_speed: 4 bytes, the speed to be applied to the
  translational part
  float rotational_speed: 4 bytes, the speed to be applied to the
  rotational part
